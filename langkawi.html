                    <p>Langkawi was a haven for pirates who attacked junks in the northern part of the Strait of Malacca. 
                        In a series of operations, between December 1945 and March 1946, the British cleared the pirates’ land bases on Langkawi and Tarutao. 
                        The British continued to rule until Malaya gained its independence in 1957. The story of Langkawi starts long before the dinosaurs roamed the on Earth. 
                        The northwest part of Palau Langkawi is made up from rock formations that are more than 500 million years old. These rocks are some of the oldest in the world and hold fossils that tell the story of early evolution on Earth.
                        Today these rocks nurture legends about the origin of the island and its folk history. Langkawi has been a part of the Kedah Sultanate for over two millennia. Although recorded history is limited, the island is mentioned by travellers of the Yuan and Ming dynasties around the 14th century. During this time Langkawi was sparsely populated. Its primary occupants were fishermen from the Malaysian peninsula and pirates. 
                        It was also used to grow and sell pepper that was a much sought-after spice in the 17th century.
