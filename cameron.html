                        Officially, Cameron Highlands was discovered in 1885 by Sir William Cameron, an English surveyor. The dense vegetation and beautiful mountain plateaus captivated him and his companion Kulop Riau. 
                        The BOH Plantation in Ringlet, established in 1929, is the first highland tea plantation in Malaysia. Cameron Highlands was found in 1885 by William Cameron which was eventually have the area named in his honour. 
                        William Cameron, a British colonial government surveyor, accompanied by his companion, Kulop Riau, went on a mapping expedition of the Titiwangsa Range. In the expedition, they used elephants to carry them for months in a journey to explore the Titiwangsa Range. 
                        They started their adventurous tour from Tanjung Rambutan and started to trace the Kinta River to its origin. They then went through the Titiwangsa Range in a south – easterly direction. Not long after that, they stood on the summit of Mount Pondok Challi. Cameron reported that he saw a plateau, of an elevation of 4,400 to 4,500ft, at an altitude of ~6000ft (1,800m) above sea-level and the temperature falls between 8C and 25C.
                        But Cameron failed to mark his find on the map. In the 1920s, the location of the plateau was finally confirmed by a consensus of reports from subsequent expeditions. That’s how Cameron Highlands was discovered. It was not fully developed until 1925 that it was then proposed by Sir George Maxwell as a hill resort.
